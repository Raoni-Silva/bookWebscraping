# **WebScraping**

## **1. Business Context**

The Tea O'Clock is a tea shop in London that wants to became a book club where people come to have a quiet and pleasant time.

Tea O'Clock want to have a good but small selection of books and after a market research they've decided to keep only books from the following category:

**- Classics** <br>
**- Science Fiction** <br>
**- Humor** <br>
**- Business** <br>

In order to decide which books to have on their store I've been asked to build a dataframe including the following infos:

**- Book name**
**- Book price (in sterling pounds)**
**- Customer rating**
**- Stock availability**

## **2. Business Context**

The output will be a csv file containing the following informations:

|column names|description|
|-----|-----|
|book_title|The title of the book|
|book_price|The price of the book in pounds|
|book_rate|The book customer rating from 1 to 5|
|book_availability|Shows if the book is available in stock|
